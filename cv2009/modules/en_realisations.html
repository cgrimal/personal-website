		The website of the <acronym title="Association of former students of the CPP of Toulouse">AAECPPT</acronym>
	</div>
	<div class="element_body">
	<p>
		I have realized this website to answer to the demand of the president of the association to set up an online directory of all the former students of the <acronym title="Polytechnic Preparatory Classes">CPP</acronym> of Toulouse, and of all the commpanies which are employing former students.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, I have develop this site using mainly <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">xHTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> for the presentation, and <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> et <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> for the database administration. I have also develop an administration section for the site, to enable the managing of the database, of the published articles, as well as sending e-mails to all the students.<br />
		According to the french laws concerning "Computer Science and Liberties", students can connect on the site to modify their datas.
	</p>
	<p>
		The website is online at <a href="http://www.aaecppt.fr">http://www.aaecppt.fr</a> and has already brung together more than 300 students !

		Project of duplicated objects management
	</div>
	<div class="element_body">
	<p>
		As a part of my training at the <acronym title="National Polytechnic Institute of Engineering in Electreotechnology, Electronics, Computer science, Hydraulics and Telecommunications">ENSEEIHT</acronym> on communicating and concurrent systems, I had carried through a project dealing with the management of duplicated objects, using Java <acronym title="Remote Method Invocation">RMI</acronym> concerning the communication between the shared out Java objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Applications could choose to share an object by registering it to the server, next, another application could decide to look for a shared object. In order to guarantee consistency of such a system, we have used the lock principle, to read or to write. An object must only have one writer or several readers at the same time.

		You can download the subject of this project (<a href="documents/Sujet_POD.pdf"><acronym title="Project of Duplicated Objects management">POD</acronym> subject in french</a>), as well as the final report (<a href="documents/Rapport_POD.pdf"><acronym title="Project of Duplicated Objects management">POD</acronym> Report in french</a>).
